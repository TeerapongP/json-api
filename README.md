API Endpoints
JSON API (Spring Boot): You can access the JSON API at https://tripsservice.onrender.com.

Search API (Spring Boot): The search API is available at https://tripsservice.onrender.com/search.

Pokemon API: You can access the Pokemon API at https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=100.

Usage
Ensure both the JSON API (Spring Boot) and the Node.js server are running.
You can interact with the JSON API and perform searches by sending requests to the provided endpoints.
The Node.js server will act as a proxy to fetch data from the JSON API on port 5000.
The Pokemon API can be used directly to fetch data about different Pokemon species.
Please make sure to have the required services running before testing your client application or making API requests.
